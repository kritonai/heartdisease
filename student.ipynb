        "Finds the **best line** (or hyperplane) that separates the two classes with the **maximum margin**.\n",
        "\n",
        "## How it works:\n",
        "1. Find the line that separates classes\n",
        "2. Maximize the distance to the nearest points from each class\n",
        "3. These nearest points are called **support vectors**\n",

        "## The Kernel Trick 🎩:\n",
        "Can handle non-linear boundaries using kernels:\n",
        "- **Linear**: Straight line separation\n",
        "- **RBF (Radial Basis Function)**: Curved, complex boundaries\n",
        "- **Polynomial**: Polynomial curves\n",
        "\n",
        "## Advantages:\n",
        "- ✅ Effective in high-dimensional spaces\n",
        "- ✅ Works well with clear margin of separation\n",
        "- ✅ Versatile (different kernels for different problems)\n",
        "- ✅ Robust to overfitting (especially with RBF kernel)\n",
        "\n",
        "## Disadvantages:\n",
        "- ❌ Slow with large datasets (>10,000 samples)\n",
        "- ❌ Sensitive to feature scaling (must scale!)\n",
        "- ❌ Hard to interpret\n",
